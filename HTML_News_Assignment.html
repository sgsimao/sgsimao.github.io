        <h1>Massive Discovery in Wisconsin: The New Particle On the Block</h1>
        <p>A new elementary particle has been dicovered here in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. On a fateful Tuesday evening, on February 22, at 5:32pm CDT, research at the Particle Mega Observatory (PMO for short) is being conducted to find evidence of the Graviton, a theorized particle said to mediate the gravitational force. However a new, never before theorized particle appeared. Researchers now believe this could be evidence of a whole new theory of our universe. The new theory could explain the existence of dark matter and provide insight on the mystery of gravity.</p>
        <p>Transitional State theory, referred to as TS theory, says that this new particle transitions between states of repelling matter and attracting other particles like it. This was observed when detections of strange waves propegated throughout the air which pushed the air molecules out of the way. This explains what's known as dark matter, the mysterious force which seems to create empty pockets of space, such as the Bo√∂tes Void. When asked about what the name for this new particle would be, Senior Observationist LeBaron Grames said <blockquote>"We aren't so sure yet. Half the team was sleeping on the job when the sensors lit up. The team usually doesn't actually do any work. Im trying to get them replaced but im still stuck with them."</blockquote>- LeBaron Games</p>
        <p>We arent really sure what that tangent was for, but it's the only intelligible thing we could gather from his drunken speech. Although this new particle has the TS equations to back it up, many physicists believe this is an error in data. They say the existence of this particle is "too convenient" and "outrageous". One disgrunteled professor said <blockquote>"It's insane to suddenly make a whole new mathematical explanation for our world all because of one particle we've never seen before suddenly pops up. It's most likely a faulty sensor or one of those employees faking it." </blockquote>-@top10gamingMLGmoments on X, formerly Twitter</p>
        Wether this new particle is capable of holding its place as a real particle, or becoming garbage data, we won't know for a long time. The technology used at the PMO has existed for <em>55 years</em> now, and it may take another 55 years to see the same effects observed a few days ago.
